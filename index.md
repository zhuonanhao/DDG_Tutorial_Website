Why DDG?
</span>

## Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG)

*Discrete differential geometry (DDG)* has emerged as a promising alternative numerical framework for simulating flexible structures. DDG provides a discrete representation of geometry that *directly encodes curvature, torsion, and deformation mechanics*, making it particularly suitable for modeling elastic structures. Unlike FEM and FDM, which approximate geometric properties from a continuous formulation, DDG *operates on discrete geometric quantities*, ensuring consistency in shape representation and numerical stability.

### Key Advantages of the DDG Method:

- **Intrinsic Geometric Preservation**: Naturally respects geometric invariants, making it well-suited for thin and highly deformable structures.
- **Robustness to Large Deformations**: Avoids locking effects and enables accurate modeling of bending and twisting deformations.
- **Efficient Computation**: Scales well for complex structural dynamics.
- **Seamless External Interaction Modeling**: Easily integrates with frictional contact, fluid-structure coupling, and magnetic actuation.
