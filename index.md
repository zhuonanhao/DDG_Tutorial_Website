Why DDG?
</span> -->

## What is Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG)?

*Discrete differential geometry (DDG)* has emerged as a promising alternative numerical framework for simulating flexible structures. DDG provides a discrete representation of geometry that *directly encodes curvature, torsion, and deformation mechanics*, making it particularly suitable for modeling elastic structures. Unlike FEM and FDM, which approximate geometric properties from a continuous formulation, DDG *operates on discrete geometric quantities*, ensuring consistency in shape representation and numerical stability.

## Key Advantages of the DDG Method:

- **Intrinsic Geometric Preservation**: DDG maintains curvature and topological constraints, making it particularly well-suited for thin and highly deformable structures.
- **Robustness to Large Deformations**: Unlike FEM, DDG avoids locking effects and accurately captures bending, twisting, and instability-driven deformations.
- **Efficient Computation**: DDG simplifies numerical integration, leading to faster and more stable simulations compared to traditional methods.
- **Seamless External Interaction Modeling**: Interaction with external fields, such as magneto-elastica coupling, fluid-structure interactions, and contact with solids can be incorporated without compromising geometric consistency.
